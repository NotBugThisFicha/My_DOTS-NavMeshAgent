# My_DOTS-NavMeshAgent
 DOTS 1.0 Producive PathFinding by NavMeshQuere
 
This project is my upgraded version(alpha) of the Forging Station blogger code for path finding

Upgrade Supports: 
1) Unity Version 2022.1 or higher 
2) Entities Package 1.0.0-pre15 or higher

!!!

At the moment, the project is at the stage of completion, it is necessary to fix some bugs related to the PathUtils struct, but the pathfinding itself is already working and the waypoints buffer for each entity(Agent) is filling up, and unit is moving on path.
